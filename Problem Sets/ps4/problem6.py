# A game consists of playing multiple hands. We need to implement one final function to complete our word-game program. Write the code that implements the playGame function. You should remove the code that is currently uncommented in the playGame body. Read through the specification and make sure you understand what this function accomplishes. For the game, you should use the HAND_SIZE constant to determine the number of cards in a hand.
#
# Testing: Try out this implementation as if you were playing the game. Try out different values for HAND_SIZE with your program, and be sure that you can play the wordgame with different hand sizes by modifying only the variable HAND_SIZE.
#
# Sample Output
# Here is how the game output should look...
#
# Loading word list from file...
#    83667 words loaded.
# Enter n to deal a new hand, r to replay the last hand, or e to end game: r
# You have not played a hand yet. Please play a new hand first!
#
# Enter n to deal a new hand, r to replay the last hand, or e to end game: n
# Current Hand: p z u t t t o
# Enter word, or a "." to indicate that you are finished: tot
# "tot" earned 9 points. Total: 9 points
#
# Current Hand: p z u t
# Enter word, or a "." to indicate that you are finished: .
# Goodbye! Total score: 9 points.
#
# Enter n to deal a new hand, r to replay the last hand, or e to end game: r
# Current Hand: p z u t t t o
# Enter word, or a "." to indicate that you are finished: top
# "top" earned 15 points. Total: 15 points
#
# Current Hand: z u t t
# Enter word, or a "." to indicate that you are finished: tu
# Invalid word, please try again.
#
# Current Hand: z u t t
# Enter word, or a "." to indicate that you are finished: .

# "qi" earned 22 points. Total: 46 points
#
# Current Hand: f f

#
# Enter n to deal a new hand, r to replay the last hand, or e to end game: n
# Current Hand: a r e t i i n
# Enter word, or a "." to indicate that you are finished: inertia
# "inertia" earned 99 points. Total: 99 points.
#
# Run out of letters. Total score: 99 points.
#
# Enter n to deal a new hand, r to replay the last hand, or e to end game: x
# Invalid command.
# Enter n to deal a new hand, r to replay the last hand, or e to end game: e

#
# Hints about the output
# Be sure to inspect the above sample output carefully - very little is actually printed out in this function specifically. Most of the printed output actually comes from the code you wrote in playHand - be sure that your code is modular and uses function calls to the playHand helper function!
#
# You should also make calls to the dealHand helper function. You shouldn't make calls to any other helper function that we've written so far - in fact, this function can be written in about 15-20 lines of code.
#
# Here is the above output, with the output from playHand obscured:

# Enter n to deal a new hand, r to replay the last hand, or e to end game: n

# Invalid command.

# Hopefully this hint makes the problem seem a bit more approachable.

# Entering Your Code
# Be sure to only paste your definition for playGame in the following box. Do not include any other function definitions.
#
# A Cool Trick about 'print'
# A cool trick about print: you can make two or more print statements print to the same line! Try out the following code. It will separate the first and second line with a space, and the second and third line with a "?" rather than putting each on a new line.
#
# print('Hello', end = " ")
# print('world', end="?")
# print('!')
